       A data-lift attribute invokes a snippet that surrounds this
       <div> with the default chrome for the site
       and inserts the <div> at the "content"
       marker in the template

	    Lift supports designer friendly templates.
	    This means that all templates... all pages
	    on your site can be valid Html5 or XHTML.
	    Your designers can edit the same pages that
	    your developers edit.  The designers do not
	    have to learn any tag libraries or any other
	    language.  The dynamic content is based on 
	    Lift's snippets and the snippet invocation
	    is done via specially css class names.
	    Here's the source for this page:
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <!-- Invoke the ShowCode snippet which 
	   shows the source for the designated page
	   and generates a link to the GitHub repository
	   for this project -->
      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/templates.html">view code</pre>

      <div>
	<big>
	  <big>
	    The benefits to your team include:
	    <ul>
	      <li>A single place for all your team members
	      to keep their code</li>
	      <li>No need for developers to "shred" the
		pages designers give them or otherwise
		keep pages in sync</li>
	      <li>Pages can always be validated </li>
	      <li>No additional learning for the designers</li>
	    </ul>
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

    </div>
  </body>
