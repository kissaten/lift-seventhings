	    One of Lift's key features in Comet (or server push)
	    support and associated Ajax support.
	    This page contains a multi-user chat application
	    with Comet (server-push) that updates the browser
	    when anyone sends a chat message.  There's an
	    input box that allows the user to send a line into
	    the chat and that's done via an asynchronous call to
	    the server (the page is not reloaded as part of the call).
	  </big>
	</big>
      </p>

      <div style="margin: 12px; border: 2px solid purple">
	<ul data-lift="comet?type=Chat">
	  <li>Line 1</li>
	  <li class="clearable">Line 2</li>
	  <li class="clearable">Line 3</li>
	</ul>
	
	<form data-lift="Form.ajax">
	  <input data-lift="ChatIn" id="chat_in">
	  <input type="submit" value="Chat">
	</form>
      </div>

      <big>
	<big>
	  Let's take a look at the markup for the
	  Comet (server pushed list of chat items)
	  part of the application:
	</big>
      </big>
      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/comet.html;start=ul+;end=form">view code</pre>

      <div>
	<big>
	  <big>
	    We simply define the markup and mark the &lt;ul> tag
	    with a snippet invocation that loads the <tt>Chat</tt>
	    Comet component.  Let's look at the <tt>Chat</tt>
	    component.
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/net/liftweb/seventhings/comet/Chat.scala;start=**;end=**">view code</pre>


      <div>

	    Once again, something that's hard or impossible
	    in other web frameworks is is trivial in Lift.
	    The developer doesn't worry about the plumbing of how
	    the browser polls for changes. By default Lift uses
	    long polling and multiplexes multiple comet components
	    into a single long poll, but when web sockets are 
	    standardized, Lift will automatically support them
	    without requiring any code changes.  The developer
	    focuses on the semantics of "when this changes on the
	    server, update the component" and Lift takes care of the
	    rest.

	    Note that you can attempt to attack the site with
	    a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross site scripting</a> attack (e.g., type <tt>&lt;script>alert('I ownz your machine')&lt/script></tt> into the chat box).  You'll see that Lift
	    properly escapes the input without any developer intervention.
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <br>
      
      <div>
	<big>
	  <big>
	    Let's take a look at the markup for the Ajax input form:
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/comet.html;start=form;end=div">view code</pre>

      <div>
	<big>
	  <big>
	    We designate the <tt>form</tt> as Ajax with the <tt>Form.ajax</tt>
	    snippet.  The text input invokes the <tt>ChatIn</tt>
	    snippet.  Let's look at that snippet:
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/net/liftweb/seventhings/snippet/ChatIn.scala;start=**">view code</pre>

      <div>
	<big>
	  <big>
	    Once again, we didn't need to do any plumbing.  Lift
	    takes care of associating the behavior (sending the input
	    <tt>String</tt> to the <tt>ChatServer</tt>.)  We didn't
	    set up routes or anything else.  Further, this code is 
	    resistant to replay attacks because the automatically
	    generated routes are dynamic and random and cannot
	    be predicted.  And in case you're worried about doing
	    things via standard REST calls, Lift has
	    <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/REST_Web_Services">excellent REST support</a>.
	    And Lift supports Comet for data as well as
	    HTML, so you can use Lift to serve your 
	    <a href="http://frothy.liftweb.net/capp">Cappuccino</a>,
	    SproutCore, ExtJS, etc. apps and get full Comet support.
