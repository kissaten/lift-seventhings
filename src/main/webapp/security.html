	    Lift based web apps have a lot of security baked
	    right in.  Lift apps are resistant to many common
	    security vulnerabilities.
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <div>

	  <big>
	    Here are Lift's built-in safeguards to combat
	    many of the 
	    <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-Main">OWASP Top 10</a> vulnerabilities:
	    <ul>
	      <li>A1: Injection - Lift's Mapper and Record do proper
	      escaping of query strings before they are sent to the
	      backing store.</li>
	      <li>A2: XSS - Lift keeps the rendered page as a DOM
		until very late in the page rendering cycle.  This allows
		Lift to automatically HTML escape Strings before they
		are sent to the browser.</li>
	      <li>A3: Session Management - Lift uses the J/EE container's
		session management, allows for generation of new sessions
		on login, and keeps passwords hashed at all times with
		per-row salt.</li>
	      <li>A4: Direct Object References - Lift forms do
		not expose direct object references, but instead keep
		the object references server-side and issues a session-specific
		token that refers to the objects.</li>
	      <li>A5: CSRF - Lift uses session-specific bindings between
		HTML elements and the server-side behaviors associated
		with those elements.  The bindings cannot be predicted
		so it's not possible to issue Cross Site requests that
		invoke session-specific bindings.</li>
	      <li>A8: URL Access - Lift includes <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/SiteMap">SiteMap</a> which provides declarative
		rules for access to URLs in the application.
		SiteMap will deny access to URLs unless the criteria
		is met for accessing the specific URL.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>

      <div>

	  <big>
	    Because Lift apps are more secure by default,
	    developers can focus their development efforts on
	    features rather than writing <i>ad hoc</i> defenses
	    to the OWASP Top 10 and other vulnerabilities.
