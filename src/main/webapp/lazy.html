      <big><big>Notice the spinning icon above this paragraph?&nbsp; That

	  rendered back to the browser and when the computation for that part of
	  screen real-estate is complete, the HTML will be delivered to the
	  browser.&nbsp; And, you can have more than one lazy loaded components
	  on the same page: </big></big><br>
      <div data-lift="LazyLoad">

      <big><big>How hard is the code? Here's the display part of the code:</big></big><br>
      </div>
      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/lazy.html;start=LazyLoad;end=big">view code</pre>
      <div>

	  <big>
	    That's not a lot of markup code.  Just mark the
	    block of markup that's going to take a long time to 
	    calculate.  Lift takes care of the rest.
	    Let's look at the <a href="http://stable.simply.liftweb.net/#sec:Snippets">snippet</a> code:
	  </big>
	</big>
      </div>
      <pre data-lift="ShowCode?name=/net/liftweb/seventhings/snippet/LongTime.scala;start=**">view code</pre>
      <div>
	<big>
	  <big>
	    Most other frameworks don't have lazy loading as part of
	    the core framework.  It's generally very hard to do, but
	    because Lift has excellent 
	    <span data-lift="Menu.item?name=comet">comet</span>
	    support, it's easy to "push" content from the
	    server to the browser.
