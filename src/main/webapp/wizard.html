	    Lift's Wizard allows you to define 
	    multi-page input screens with field and
	    form level validation that can be run 
	    either as normal HTTP forms (with full back-
	    button support) or as Ajax.

	    Wizard offers functionality similar to JBoss
	    Seam.  However, Wizard purely declarative code
	    rather than Java + XML.  Further, all Wizard
	    fields are type safe.  For example, the age field
	    is an Int, so you can multiply the age by 3
	    without explicit casting.

	    Wizard allows you to model complex user inputs...
	    super-forms... declaratively so that the logic
	    is obvious and the maintainence is simple.
